'''
    Simulate a banking system problem statement:
    1.- Give a prompt to the user asking if they wish to create a new savings
    account or access an existing one.
    2.- If the user would like to create a new account, accept their name,
    Initial deposit, create a 5 random digit number and make it as the account
    number of their saving account.
    3.- If they are accessing an existing account accept their name and account
    number to validate the user, give them options to withdraw, deposit or 
    display their available balance.
